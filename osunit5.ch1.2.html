        <h1>Structures of Directory in Operating System</h1>
        <p>A directory is a container that is used to contain folders and files. It organizes files and folders in a
            hierarchical manner.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/111-11.png" alt="">
        <p>Following are the logical structures of a directory, each providing a solution to the problem faced in
            previous type of directory structure.</p>

        <h2>1) Single-level directory</h2>
        <p>The single-level directory is the simplest directory structure. In it, all files are contained in the same
            directory which makes it easy to support and understand.</p>
        <p>A single level directory has a significant limitation, however, when the number of files increases or when
            the system has more than one user. Since all the files are in the same directory, they must have a unique
            name. If two users call their dataset test, then the unique name rule is violated.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/222-13.png" alt="">
        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Since it is a single directory, its implementation is very easy.</li>
            <li>If the files are smaller in size, searching will become faster.</li>
            <li>The operations like file creation, searching, deletion, updating are very easy in such a directory
                structure.</li>
            <li>Logical Organization: Directory structures help to logically organize files and directories in a
                hierarchical structure. This provides an easy way to navigate and manage files, making it easier for
                users to access the data they need.</li>
            <li>Increased Efficiency: Directory structures can increase the efficiency of the file system by reducing
                the time required to search for files. This is because directory structures are optimized for fast file
                access, allowing users to quickly locate the file they need.</li>
            <li>Improved Security: Directory structures can provide better security for files by allowing access to be
                restricted at the directory level. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and
                ensures that important files are protected.</li>
            <li>Facilitates Backup and Recovery: Directory structures make it easier to backup and recover files in the
                event of a system failure or data loss. By storing related files in the same directory, it is easier to
                locate and backup all the files that need to be protected.</li>
            <li>Scalability: Directory structures are scalable, making it easy to add new directories and files as
                needed. This helps to accommodate growth in the system and makes it easier to manage large amounts of
                data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There may be a chance of name collision because two files can have the same name.</li>
            <li>Searching will become time-consuming if the directory is large.</li>
            <li>This cannot group the same type of files together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Two-level directory</h2>
        <p>As we have seen, a single-level directory often leads to confusion of file names among different users. The
            solution to this problem is to create a separate directory for each user.</p>
        <p>In the two-level directory structure, each user has their own user files directory (UFD). The UFDs have
            similar structures, but each lists only the files of a single user. The system’s master file directory (MFD)
            is searched whenever a new user id is created.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230620202955/d1.png" alt="">
        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The main advantage is there can be more than two files with the same name, and it would be very helpful
                if there are multiple users.</li>
            <li>Security would be there which would prevent users from accessing other users’ files.</li>
            <li>Searching of the files becomes very easy in this directory structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As there is an advantage of security, there is also a disadvantage that the user cannot share the file
                with other users.</li>
            <li>Unlike the advantage users can create their own files, users don’t have the ability to create
                subdirectories.</li>
            <li>Scalability is not possible because one user can’t group the same types of files together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3) Tree Structure/ Hierarchical Structure</h2>
        <p>The tree directory structure of an operating system is most commonly used in our personal computers. Users
            can create files and subdirectories too, which was a disadvantage in the previous directory structures.</p>
        <p>This directory structure resembles a real tree upside down, where the root directory is at the peak. This
            root contains all the directories for each user. The users can create subdirectories and even store files in
            their directory.</p>
        <p>A user does not have access to the root directory data and cannot modify it. And, even in this directory, the
            user does not have access to other users’ directories. The structure of the tree directory is given below
            which shows how there are files and subdirectories in each user’s directory.</p>
        <img width="100%" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230620221412/d2.png" alt="">
        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This directory structure allows subdirectories inside a directory.</li>
            <li>The searching is easier.</li>
            <li>File sorting of important and unimportant files becomes easier.</li>
            <li>This directory is more scalable than the other two directory structures explained.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As the user isn’t allowed to access other users’ directories, this prevents file sharing among users.
            </li>
            <li>As the user has the capability to make subdirectories, if the number of subdirectories increases, the
                searching may become complicated.</li>
            <li>Users cannot modify the root directory data.</li>
            <li>If files do not fit in one, they might have to be fit into other directories.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Acyclic Graph Structure</h2>
        <p>As we have seen the above three directory structures, none of them have the capability to access one file
            from multiple directories. The file or the subdirectory could be accessed through the directory it was
            present in, but not from the other directory.</p>
        <p>This problem is solved in acyclic graph directory structure, where a file in one directory can be accessed
            from multiple directories. In this way, the files could be shared between the users. It is designed in a way
            that multiple directories point to a particular directory or file with the help of links.</p>
        <p>In the below figure, this explanation can be nicely observed, where a file is shared between multiple users.
            If any user makes a change, it would be reflected to both the users.</p>

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sharing of files and directories is allowed between multiple users.</li>
            <li>Searching becomes too easy.</li>
            <li>Flexibility is increased as file sharing and editing access is there for multiple users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Because of the complex structure it has, it is difficult to implement this directory structure.</li>
            <li>The user must be very cautious to edit or even delete a file as the file is accessed by multiple users.
            </li>
            <li>If we need to delete the file, then we need to delete all the references of the file in order to delete
                it permanently.</li>
        </ul>
